#### Locally

This application runs on Node LTS, which is currently `v20.12.2`. There are some
features (for example, `.toSliced`) this project uses that are only available on
Node.js LTS and above. This matches the configuration set on Vercel.

```sh
bun dev --host
```

#### Building

##### Using Astro

```sh
bun run build
```

##### Using Vercel CLI

```sh
bunx vc build
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> [!CAUTION]
> If you donâ€™t build with `vc`, you will have to manually copy over the security headers (CSP) defined in `astro.config.ts` into `.vercel/output/config.json`

#### Deploying

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fyeskunall%2Fwww)

###### The goal is to ultimately deploy the site to Cloudflare Pages using [`@astrojs/cloudflare`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare)
