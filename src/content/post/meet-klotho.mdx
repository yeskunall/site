import Callout from "../../components/blog/Callout.astro";

Cloud services are remarkably useful for two use-cases: the first is when your
application is simple, and has low traffic such that you save on complexity and,
thus time, by leveraging with fully-managed services. The second is when your
server load is unpredictable, or when you have no idea whether you need ten
servers or a hundred.

However, I think we can all agree that working with the cloud can quickly become
incredibly complex, and the top 3 cloud providers require huge investments (both
cost and time) to understand how to configure, learn, assemble, and scale them
properly.

To try and remedy this problem, there’s a lot of existing solutions out there.
Some approaches include introducing cloud-native programming languages like
[Dark](https://darklang.com/), [Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev/) and
[Wing](https://www.winglang.io/), [Ampt](https://getampt.com/) (spun off from
[Serverless Inc.](https://www.serverless.com/cloud)),
[Modal](https://modal.com/) and [Nitric](https://nitric.io/) are tackling it by
introducing their own SDKs that you can use directly in your existing code,
others like [Encore](https://encore.dev/) and [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/)
are building frameworks to reduce inefficiency, and to strip away the monotony
and repetition involved in deploying cloud services. This paradigm shift is
being labelled
[Infrastructure _from_ Code](https://www.infrastructurefromcode.com/) (IfC).

Then there’s Klotho: it lets you write larger applications while taking care of
the cloud integrations, smaller pieces, and technologies using pure in-code
_annotations_. Its job is to understand your application’s architecture, not to
define it. It does this by:

- Ensuring your code is **debuggable**, **recognizable**, and **patchable**—even
  in production
- _Integrating_ with your existing ecosystem instead of trying to replace it
- Keeping _existing_ tools and programming languages usable
- Maintaining benefits from _existing_ architectures

All of this is explained in great detail in
[this](https://klo.dev/the-cloud-architecture-of-the-next-10-years-part2/) post.

## Adaptive Architecture

![Adaptive Architecture diagram](https://blog.kimchiii.space/content/images/2023/01/shapes.svg)

The diagram above is essentially a replica what you can find
[here](https://adaptive-architectures.tech/).

Adaptive architecture is a system that alters its behavior, resources, or
structure on-demand, usually focusing on non-functional characteristics rather
than functional ones. That’s a very generic definition. (in fact, I just
reworded what you can find on _Wikipedia_)

I think where this can be useful is where applications have to scale quickly due
to sudden spikes in demand, or ones that require frequent updates. They can also
be easily updated or scaled up and down to meet the needs of the business.

Since the white-paper for this isn’t available yet, I don’t want to talk make
any baseless assumptions. That being said, I’m looking forward to dig deeper
into ‘**adaptive architecture**.’

## Write code for you, not the cloud

Ever written a piece of code that works perfectly well locally, but then you go
to deploy it to the cloud and
[it](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-java-worker/issues/140)
[just](https://www.itwriting.com/blog/4621-hands-on-debugging-an-azure-application-what-to-do-when-it-works-locally-but-not-in-the-cloud.html)
[doesn’t](https://serverfault.com/questions/1070510/application-works-locally-but-fails-with-502-in-cloud-run-upstream-connect-e)
[work](https://www.reddit.com/r/Firebase/comments/ib5yaz/function_works_locally_but_not_deployed/)?
It’s such a common problem that Render has a dedicated
[blog post](https://render.com/blog/it-works-fine-locally) to ensure you don’t
end up saying “**but it works locally**.”

When something breaks, you don’t know whether it’s on your side or if it’s in
the magic box under someone else’s management. Aaron Torres puts it perfectly:

Write code for you, not the cloud, and let Klotho handle the rest.

As of now, the only
[_libraries_](https://klo.dev/docs/api/nodejs/expose/#supported-libraries)
supported are Express, NestJS, and a
[custom](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server) Next.js
server. It looks like support for additional libraries depends on how quickly
the team can adapt the compiler to transform code for
[each](https://github.com/klothoplatform/klotho/blob/main/pkg/lang/javascript/nodejs.go)
[library](https://github.com/klothoplatform/klotho/blob/main/pkg/lang/javascript/nestjs.go).

I’m going to try to build a simple REST API using Express, then try to deploy it
as a serverless function to AWS Lambda.

Even though AWS Lambda supports ES modules and top-level `await{:ts}`, _Klotho_
currently doesn’t.

<Callout type="caution" title="Warning">
  This also means that your Lambda functions cannot make use of [Provisioned
  Concurrency](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/using-node-js-es-modules-and-top-level-await-in-aws-lambda/).
  I hope they can add support for this soon
</Callout>

Now for the Express app:

```ts
const express = require("express");

const app = express();

const PORT = 3000;

function setupExpressApp() {
  const app = express();
  const router = express.Router();

  router.use(cors());
  router.use(express.json());

  return { app, router };
}

const { app, router } = setupExpressApp();

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});

exports.app = app;
```

For now, it doesn’t do anything but spin up a server on port `3000{:ts}`. I’m
curious to see how the compiler handles this instance.

## In comes Klotho

Let’s **Klotho-_ify_** this Lambda by adding a
[capability](https://klo.dev/docs/concepts/capabilities/). The syntax for that
looks something like this:

```ts
/** @klotho::capability {
 * }
 */
```

These [annotations](https://klo.dev/docs/concepts/capabilities/#annotation) are
used to control the behaviour of the compiler, and are usually specified as
comments above the code to be transformed. If you want to expose your Lambda,
then you need to add the `expose` capability to your code.

```ts
/**
 * @klotho::expose {
 *  id = "api-gateway"
 *  target = "public"
 * }
 */
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

> The term capability is starting to make sense now...

As of now, you must pass the `target` _directive_
([set](https://klo.dev/docs/api/nodejs/expose/#directives) to `public`) in order
to expose your Lambda function to the Internet.

<Callout type="note" title="Directives in Klotho">
  A [directive](https://klo.dev/docs/concepts/capabilities/#directives) helps
  provide your capability with any missing information that the _Klotho_
  compiler can’t figure out what code transformations are necessary simply by
  inspecting your code
</Callout>

The compiler generates transformations for particular cloud services, which
_Klotho_ calls [_providers_](https://klo.dev/docs/api/nodejs/expose#providers).
When you use the `expose` capability, it uses
[API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) as the provider.

Let’s use the CLI to generate the compiled (transformed) code:

```sh
klotho . --app klotho-afc-example --provider aws
██╗  ██╗██╗      ██████╗ ████████╗██╗  ██╗ ██████╗
██║ ██╔╝██║     ██╔═══██╗╚══██╔══╝██║  ██║██╔═══██╗

| 29| });

Pulumi.klotho-afc-example.yaml: Make sure to run `pulumi config set aws:region YOUR_REGION --cwd 'compiled/' -s 'klotho-afc-example'` to configure the target AWS region.
```

The warning makes sense. Because the Lambda does _nothing_ at this point, it
makes sense to allocate no resources to it.

The compiler also generates a topology each time there is a change in your
architecture or code. Here’s what my topology diagram looks like right now:

![Initial topology diagaram](https://blog.kimchiii.space/content/images/2023/01/ts-serverless-klotho.png)

I know, it’s not much of a topology (_yet_). But let’s break it down regardless.
The `main` Lambda function serves the Express app defined in
`klotho-afc-example` using a Lambda-compatible interface. _Klotho_ refers to the
`main` Lambda function as an `execution_unit`.

An application is composed of one or more
[_execution units_](https://klo.dev/docs/tutorials/your_first_klotho_app#execution-unit),
with each execution unit being responsible for executing a discrete portion of
the application's code.

The compiler defines the main `execution_unit` by looking into the `main` field
in `package.json{:ts}`. Because I did not define a `main` entrypoint, nor define
an `execution_unit` myself, it deterministically figured out the execution unit
using the existing `expose` capability. _Smart!_

In this case, it was able to generate the `compiled` directory because of the
presence of a `package.json{:ts}` in the root directory, which they call a
[_project file_](https://klo.dev/docs/concepts/capabilities/execution_unit/project_file).

<Callout type="note" title="Good to know">
  _Klotho_ always associates a `Dockerfile` with each execution unit within an
  application. If you do not provide one, it will autogenerate one for you
</Callout>

This means that _Klotho_ uses container-based Lambda functions, which have their
own pros and cons. However, as long as the compiler
[optimizes](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/optimizing-lambda-functions-packaged-as-container-images/)
the Lambda function packaged as container images, we should be mostly good.

You should see a `compiled` directory at the root-level of your project. This is
what it looks like on my end:

```sh
compiled
├── iac
├── main
├── Pulumi.klotho-afc-example.yaml
├── Pulumi.yaml
├── deploylib.ts
├── index.ts
├── klotho-afc-example.json
├── klotho-afc-example.png
├── klotho.yaml
├── package.json
├── resources.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

I’m going to skip the `iac` directory and instead focus on the `main` directory
right now. These are its contents:

```sh
compiled/main
├── klotho_runtime
├── Dockerfile
├── index.js
└── package.json
```

Along with a bunch of generated files, here you’ll find the `Dockerfile`
associated with the execution unit. Let’s examine that:

```dockerfile
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/nodejs:16

COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . ./

CMD [ "klotho_runtime/dispatcher.handler" ]
```

> Okay, now I’m confused. If the Docker image uses Node 16, then why can’t I use
> ES6 imports?

<Callout type="note" title="About Node LTS">
  At the time of writing this, Node 18 is LTS, but _Klotho_ seems to be using a
  previous release
</Callout>

Moving on, if you look inside `dispatcher.js{:ts}`, you’ll see that the
`handler` at this point throws if you were to make a request to the Lambda:

```ts
async function webserverResponse(event, context) {
  throw new Error(
    "execution unit not configured to receive webserver payloads",
  );
}
```

That’s pretty cool. It essentially tries its best to mimic the local setup,
i.e., if you were to run this app locally right now, you’d get an error:

```sh
curl "http://localhost:3000"

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Error</title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>Cannot GET /</pre>
</body>
</html>
```

What if I added an empty router configuration to the Express app?

```ts
...

const { app, router } = setupExpressApp();

app.use(router);

/**
 * @klotho::expose {
 *  id = "api-gateway"
 *  target = "public"
 * }
 */
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});

...
```

Running _Klotho_ this time yields:

```sh
██╗  ██╗██╗      ██████╗ ████████╗██╗  ██╗ ██████╗

Adding resource input_file_dependencies:
Adding resource exec_unit:main
No routes found for middleware 'router'                                                             unit: main
Adding resource gateway:api-gateway
Adding catchall route for gateway {FilePath:index.js AppVarName:app gatewayId:api-gateway} with no detected routes
                                                                                                     unit: main
Adding resource topology:klotho-afc-example
Adding resource aws_template_data:klotho-afc-example
Adding resource infra_as_code:Pulumi (AWS)
```

_Interesting_. The above code change made no difference to how the app runs
locally, but the compiler seems to have added a “catch-all” route.

This time, I’m going to add a very basic API route to add and get pugs (🐶),
while explicitly stating its a separate execution unit:

```ts
/**
 * @klotho::execution_unit {
 *  id = "pugs"
 * }
 */

 ...

 /**
 * @klotho::persist {
 *  id = "dog-ddb"
 * }
 */
const store = new Map();

async function addPug(request, response) {
  ..
}

async function getPug(request, response) {
  ...
}
```

If I did everything correctly, the compiler should add a resource for the `pugs`
execution unit. I also used another _Klotho_ capability
[`persist`](https://klo.dev/docs/api/nodejs/persist) on a key-value `store`. The
compiler should also pick this up and generate code to create a
[DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) resource. Let’s try it:

```sh
██╗  ██╗██╗      ██████╗ ████████╗██╗  ██╗ ██████╗
██║ ██╔╝██║     ██╔═══██╗╚══██╔══╝██║  ██║██╔═══██╗

╚═╝  ╚═╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝    ╚═╝   ╚═╝  ╚═╝ ╚═════╝

Adding resource input_file_dependencies:
Adding resource exec_unit:pugs
No routes found for middleware 'router'                                                             unit: pugs
Found 2 route(s) for middleware 'pugs'                                                              unit: pugs
Adding resource gateway:api-gateway
Adding resource persist_kv:dog-ddb
Adding resource topology:klotho-afc-example
Adding resource aws_template_data:klotho-afc-example
Adding resource infra_as_code:Pulumi (AWS)
```

_Nice!_ The topology diagram should also have been affected. Let’s see:

![Updated topology diagram](https://blog.kimchiii.space/content/images/2023/01/klotho-afc-example-1.png)

You can add and get pugs (🐶), but what if you wanted to adopt a pug? Time to
add another execution unit, but instead of using DynamoDB as the provider, I’m
going to use [Elasticache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/):

```ts
/**
 * @klotho::execution_unit {
 *  id = "adopt"
 * }
 */

...

/**
 * @klotho::persist {
 *  id = "cache"
 * }
 */
const client = createClient();

...

await client.connect({ url: process.env.ELASTICACHE_URL });

...

async function adoptionStatus(request, response) {
  ...
}

async function approveAdoption(request, response) {
  ...
}

async function refuseAdoption(request, response) {
  ...
}

async function requestAdoption(request, response) {
  ...
}
```

The topology diagram was updated to reflect the new resource:

![Updated topology diagram](https://blog.kimchiii.space/content/images/2023/01/klotho-afc-example-2.png)

What would the topology look like if I didn’t specify multiple execution points?
Well, the compiler _should_ refer to the project file and use `main` as the
execution unit. Let’s try that, too:

```sh

Here’s what the topology diagram looks like now:

![Updated topology diagram](https://blog.kimchiii.space/content/images/2023/01/klotho-afc-example-3.png)

In both instances, the `api-gateway` resource is used to expose the API route
defined in the `main` Lambda function.

Next, I want to go over `klotho.yaml{:yaml}`, which is what Klotho uses to
create the resources for your compiled application. Here’s mine:

Under `defaults`, you can see all the available capabilities, and their default
providers.

<Callout type="tip" title="Overriding defaults">
  You can override the default values by passing your own [configuration
  file](https://klo.dev/docs/concepts/configuration/) to the CLI. The compiler
  will end up merging your passed-in config into the existing `klotho.yaml`
</Callout>

This configuration file sorta reminds me of how you define resources in a
[SAM template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-reference.html).

Under the `iac` directory, you’ll see a bunch of generated code that uses the
_Pulumi_ SDK by default. The output is a lot, but I reckon that’s because it has
to generate code for each of its capability, and each provider that it supports.

<Callout type="note" title="On deploying">
  The output of `iac` does not get deployed to the cloud, but I wonder if in the
  future the compiler can only emit code for the resources that are necessary
</Callout>

It smoothly integrated with existing industry-standard solutions instead of
trying to replace it. I think **this is a huge plus-point** for _Klotho_.

<Callout type="caution" title="Klotho analytics">
  Klotho automatically creates a `.klotho/analytics.json `in your `$HOME`
  directory
</Callout>

I was bummed out to see that there was no way to turn analytics off. At least
not yet. I also don’t like how it pollutes my `$HOME` directory, even though I
have setup my machine to follow the
[XDG](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
base directory specification. The change to support this is fairly simple, but
it [mostly](https://github.com/denoland/deployctl/issues/134)
[gets](https://github.com/planetscale/cli/issues/429)
[ignored](https://github.com/railwayapp/cli/issues/206).

## Deploying

This is an area that _Klotho_ differentiates itself from the rest of the _IfC_
solutions. It will not attempt to deploy anything for you. That’s explicitly
**_not_** its job. It is responsible for generating Pulumi code and you’re
supposed to [use Pulumi directly](https://klo.dev/docs/tutorials/deploying) to
get the app deployed to the cloud.

While I understand the sentiment of maintaining benefits from _existing_
architectures, other _IfC_ solutions like Nitric and Serverless Cloud (not to be
confused with Ampt) deploy the required infrastructure (resources) from your
code to your chosen cloud provider. This _may_ hurt _Klotho_ in the long run,
but if I’m right, its _annotation_-based approach (architecture-from-code) will
give it an edge over its competitors.

## Wrapping up

I tried using most of the capabilities _Klotho_ provides, but there’s still a
lot out there to explore. Like I mentioned in the beginning, this post is
written to get an idea of the product. But after testing it out, I think that:

- **Adoption will initially be slow:** this is still a new concept (IfC), and
  even though Klotho builds upon existing infrastructure, I think some (_or
  most?_) developers will be hesitant to try it
- **The cloud will still be your bottleneck:** even though you are using _IfC_
  to reduce the complexity, and therefore the time it takes to deploy to the
  cloud, you are still limited by cold (warm) starts, failures/outages, retries,
  and service limits
- **This is extremely new (bleeding-edge) tech:** while I’m genuinely impressed
  with _Klotho_’s capability (_get it?_), the team still has a long way to go
  before it can be adopted by teams

Overall, given that _Klotho_ is currently in closed beta, it has some some
missing features: mainly its lack of support for **_most_** frameworks and
libraries, it only supports 3 languages as of now, and because it builds upon
existing technologies, you **have** to use Pulumi to ultimately deploy your
code. For a product that made its debut only last year, it already stands out
due to its adaptive architecture, and annotation-based approach. With the advent
of _IfC_ solutions, it is sure to be a major disruptor in the serverless realm.

_I would like to thank **Ala Shiban** for reaching out to me directly. I learned
a lot from this little experiment, and my overall experience with Klotho was
delightful._
