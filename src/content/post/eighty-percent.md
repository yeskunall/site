I have a confession. I am the embodiment of the sin of gluttony. However you
want to put it, I simply love eating. Sometimes I’ll eat too _daintily_, other
times I’ll eat _too much_, and sometimes I eat too _expensively_. That does not
mean I won’t eat _simple_ foods. It does not mean I _always_ overeat, and it
also does not mean I only eat _expensive_ meals. But I’d be lying if I said I
didn’t _live to eat_.

Recently, I was reading up on the _Okinawans_, and how Okinawa has the world's
highest proportion of _centenarians_. That led me to read up on their practice
of _hara hachi bu_, or eating until you are eight parts (out of ten) full. _But
how do I know I’m 80% full_, you ask? Over the last couple of months, I’ve
learned that the key here is to stop eating once you start _feeling_ full.

Another confession: I still _live to eat_, but I also don’t complain if some
days I feel hungry long after a meal, or if the food I ate is dissatisfactory.
Overall, I feel a lot more energetic these days, and I definitely do not get
sluggish after my meals any more.
