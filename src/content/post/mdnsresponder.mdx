<Callout type="note" title="Note">
  This post is written at a time where I’m running macOS Monterey (`12.6.2`),
  which comes bundled with `mDNSResponder` (`1558.0.56`)
</Callout>

I recently ran into some DNS issues, and so like always, I opened up CleanMyMac
X and ran the ‘Flush DNS Cache’ maintenance script.

This usually does the trick. However, this time after querying for the service
in question using `dig`, I was still hitting the old IPs. OK, that’s weird
because CleanMyMac simply sends a `SIGHUP` to `mDNSResponder` to purge the DNS
cache, something like this:

```sh
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```

I confirmed that it was sending the appropriate signal:

```sh
sudo log stream --info --predicate 'process == "mDNSResponder"'
```

```sh
sudo log stream --info --predicate 'process == "mDNSResponder"'
Filtering the log data using "process == "mDNSResponder""
Timestamp                       Thread     Type        Activity             PID    TTL
2023-06-26 18:30:54.592258+0530 0x394      Default     0x0                  194    0    mDNSResponder: [com.apple.mDNSResponder:Default] SIGHUP: Purge cache
```

Okay, the logs _say_ it purged the cache, but how do I know it _actually_ did
it? On Windows, I can do something like ipconfig /displaydns and it shows a list
of all cached DNS entries. The equivalent of that (or the closest) in macOS is
`sudo killall -INFO mDNSResponder{:sh}`:

```sh
sudo killall -INFO mDNSResponder
```

```sh
2023-06-26 18:40:14.687612+0530 0x394      Default     0x0                  194    0    mDNSResponder: [com.apple.mDNSResponder:Default] Sending SIGINFO to mDNSResponder daemon is deprecated. To trigger state dump, please use 'dns-sd -O', enter 'dns-sd -h' for more information
```

Maintaining/updating documentation has never been Apple’s strong suite. All
right, fine, as you say. I’ll use `dns-sd` instead.

```sh
sudo dns-sd -O

XPC service returns error, description: State dump is only enabled in internal builds
```

_Wtf?_ Why would you actively choose to disable this feature? I looked up the
closest (and previous) builds of `mDNSResponder`, and found
[some](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/mDNSResponder/blob/mDNSResponder-1310.140.1/mDNSMacOSX/xpc_services/xpc_client_log_utility.h#L37)
[answers](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/mDNSResponder/blob/mDNSResponder-1557.140.5.0.1/mDNSMacOSX/ApplePlatformFeatures.h#L114-L120):

```c
typedef enum
{
    ...,
    full_state_to_stdout = 3,           // Dump state to STDOUT
} DNSStateInfo;
```

Apple allowed you to dump state till build `1310.140.1`, but for privacy
reasons, they started logging DNS queries to `os_log` as private. In fact, a
previous build of `mDNSResponder` explicitly
[states](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/mDNSResponder/blob/mDNSResponder-1310.140.1/mDNSMacOSX/xpc_services/xpc_service_log_utility.c#L154)
that.

```c
// Feature: Support for having finer granularity of log redaction, by using os_log based-log routine.
// Radar:   <rdar://problem/42814956>
// Enabled: Yes.

#if !defined(MDNSRESPONDER_SUPPORTS_APPLE_OS_LOG)
    #define MDNSRESPONDER_SUPPORTS_APPLE_OS_LOG                     1
#endif
```

So... I should technically be able to use log to access the private data. Right?
_Wrong_.

```sh
sudo log config --mode private_data:on
log: Invalid Modes 'private_data:on'
```

After some research, I ran into
[this](https://saagarjha.com/blog/2019/09/29/making-os-log-public-on-macos-catalina)
article, which basically states that without turning off System Integrity
Protection (SIP), there is no easy way to get around the above error.

So if you’re a macOS user, you are left with no plausible way to find out your
cached DNS entries. At least you can still purge them manually. _For now_.
