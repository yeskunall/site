The inevitability of our eventual demise is a fundamental aspect of the human
condition. Our mortality is an inescapable reality that shapes our existence.
Yet, we often find ourselves disconnected from this truth.

However, the tragedy lies not in the fact that we are mortal, but in our
tendency to _forget_ our mortality and live without fully embracing the
_fleeting_ nature of life.

Instead of succumbing to the illusion of immortality, we can cultivate a sense
of _urgency_ that propels us towards meaningful actions and connections. I’ll
leave you with this quote from Confucius:

> “Every man has two lives, and the second one starts when he realizes he has
> just one.”
