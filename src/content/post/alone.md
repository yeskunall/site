A colleague jokingly asked me how I manage to live alone, and how I’ve continued
to do so, especially during the pandemic.

_“Doesn’t it get lonely?”_

I think they were confusing being alone with loneliness. People often tend to
mix the two.

I’m usually _alone_, but I wouldn’t say I’m _lonely_. In fact, it doesn’t bother
me at all.

I’m the most productive _when_ I’m alone. People in my line of work are
_expected_ to collaborate. I lean towards the opposite. I produce my best work
being locked away in a dark room. Sounds sort of grim, but that’s actually my
current setup: I live in a 100m<sup>2</sup>, dimly-lit studio apartment.

When I’m _alone_, I get to daydream, plan ahead, and reflect on things. I get to
ask myself questions **out loud** without the risk of outside bias.

When I’m _alone_, I allow myself to move with a certain sense of _urgency_.
