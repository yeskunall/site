I have noticed that there is an increasing trend of people equating (esp.
_software_) engineering to an art. Just the other day, I saw someone tweet out
that they dislike the term “Software Engineer,” and that they would rather it be
called “Software Artist(e).” I could not disagree more.

Art, by definition, is useless. Engineering, on the other hand, is not.

In a [letter](https://lettersofnote.com/2010/01/04/art-is-useless-because/)
addressed to Bernulf Clegg, Oscar Wilde said:

As a frequent flyer, I’ll take this example: I give a _damn_ about the _“art”_
behind the Flight Management System (_FMS_). I only care that it takes me safely
to my destination. In fact, I would be _**horrified**_ if I ever heard my
friends at the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (_EASA_) or at the Federal
Aviation Administration (_FAA_) mention their work as “_art_.”
