Ever since I came across [Motion One](https://motion.dev/)’s nav bar
blur-effect, I have been fascinated by how it looks. If you don’t know what I’m
talking about, take a look [here](https://motion.dev/guides/quick-start). Make
sure to scroll down a bit to _un_-hide the nav bar.

Okay, now let’s get to it:

```html /bg-gradient-radial-repeat-dot/
<div
  class="bg-gradient-radial-repeat-dot pointer-events-none fixed left-0 right-0 top-0 z-[9999] h-[75px] select-none overflow-hidden border-b-[1px] border-t-[3px] border-b-black/10 border-t-[#fff208] bg-[size:4px_4px] backdrop-blur-[3px] backdrop-brightness-[100%]"
  aria-hidden="true"
></div>
```

While Tailwind CSS does not have support for radial gradients (_yet_), we can
`extend` our `tailwind.config.(c)js/ts{:ts}` to create the intended effect, like
so:

```ts /bg-gradient-radial-repeat-dot/
...
    extend: {
      backgroundImage: {
        "gradient-radial-repeat-dot":
          "radial-gradient(rgba(0,0,0,0) 1px, var(--background) 1px)",
      },
    }
...
```

Oh you want to see it working _step-by-step_? Okay, here goes nothing. First,
we’ll get rid of the boring stuff out of the way:

```html
<div class="pointer-events-none z-[9999] select-none overflow-hidden"></div>
```

Next up, we want to make sure the `<div />{:html}` stays `fixed` in place, at
the very top of the viewport:

```html /fixed/ /left-0/ /right-0/ /top-0/
<div
  class="pointer-events-none fixed left-0 right-0 top-0 z-[9999] select-none"
></div>
```

At this stage, you still won’t see a thing. That’s because the `<div />{:html}`
contains nothing—and it won’t ever—so we need to explicitly set its `height`.
Here’s where you get to customize this to your liking:

```html /[h-75px]/
<div
  class="pointer-events-none fixed left-0 right-0 top-0 z-[9999] select-none"
></div>
```

I went with `75px`. At this point, you should still see nothing, but if you
inspect the `<div />{:html}`, you should see it takes up the height that you
just set in the previous bit. Next, let’s get that border at the top:

```html /border-t-[3px]/ /border-t-[#fff208]/
<div
  class="pointer-events-none fixed left-0 right-0 top-0 z-[9999] h-[75px] select-none overflow-hidden border-t-[3px] border-t-[#fff208]"
></div>
```

Finally, we have something to show for. But we’re far from done. Let’s also add
that border at the bottom:

```html /border-b-[1px]/ /border-b-black/10/
<div
  class="pointer-events-none fixed left-0 right-0 top-0 z-[9999] h-[75px] select-none overflow-hidden border-b-[1px] border-t-[3px] border-b-black/10 border-t-[#fff208]"
></div>
```

Now for the background effect (those _sexy_ polka dots), we’re going to first
`extend` our Tailwind CSS config as mentioned previously. Once that is done, we
can go ahead and use it:

<Callout type="tip" title="Reload your config">
  If you are not using a framework that automatically reloads when you make
  changes to your Tailwind CSS config, then you might want to restart your
  server before continuing
</Callout>

```html /bg-gradient-radial-repeat-dot/ /bg-[size:4px_4px]/
<div
  class="bg-gradient-radial-repeat-dot pointer-events-none fixed left-0 right-0 top-0 z-[9999] h-[75px] select-none overflow-hidden border-b-[1px] border-t-[3px] border-b-black/10 border-t-[#fff208] bg-[size:4px_4px]"
></div>
```

We’re almost there. Let’s add the _blur_ effect that will tie this all together:

```html /backdrop-blur-[3px]/ /backdrop-brightness-[100%]/
<div
  class="bg-gradient-radial-repeat-dot pointer-events-none fixed left-0 right-0 top-0 z-[9999] h-[75px] select-none overflow-hidden border-b-[1px] border-t-[3px] border-b-black/10 border-t-[#fff208] bg-[size:4px_4px] backdrop-blur-[3px] backdrop-brightness-[100%]"
></div>
```

At this point, you should have replicated the _blur_ effect as seen on Motion
One’s [website](https://motion.dev/guides/quick-start). Before we wrap things
up, let’s go ahead and also add the `aria-hidden{:html}` label to the
`<div />{:html}` to indicate that the element is not exposed to the
accessibility API.

```html /aria-hidden="true"/
<div
  class="bg-gradient-radial-repeat-dot pointer-events-none fixed left-0 right-0 top-0 z-[9999] h-[75px] select-none overflow-hidden border-b-[1px] border-t-[3px] border-b-black/10 border-t-[#fff208] bg-[size:4px_4px] backdrop-blur-[3px] backdrop-brightness-[100%]"
  aria-hidden="true"
></div>
```

This was a little experiment to try and see what all I can do with Tailwind CSS
before I would have to use _raw_ CSS. I know it can do way more, and this was a
very basic example.
