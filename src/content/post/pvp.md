The Internet is by default _public_, not _private_. That’s because the original
protocol was not built with privacy in mind. Quite the
[opposite](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2068#section-15.7),
actually. Whether that was the intention or not is no longer a worthwhile
discussion.

If you use Dropbox, they [admit](https://help.dropbox.com/security/file-access)
to accessing user content, and not always because they are legally required to
do so. Use Facebook or Instagram? Their in-app browser can
[_track any interaction_](https://krausefx.com/blog/ios-privacy-instagram-and-facebook-can-track-anything-you-do-on-any-website-in-their-in-app-browser)
you make on a website. If you use Snapchat, every snap you’ve sent is cached on
[_your_](https://social.techjunkie.com/view-old-snaps-in-snapchat/) device, as
well as on the device of the person you
[_sent_](https://nerdschalk.com/does-snapchat-save-your-snaps/) it to, as long
as they’ve opened it. Use Spotify to listen to music? They track
[_everything_](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1025024813889478656) you do,
down to
[_what brand of ear/head-phones_](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1025029133175336960)
you use. Use TikTok? They
[scan](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/us/privacy-policy/en) and analyze your
**keystrokes** and **messages**, and collect your **faceprints** and
**voiceprints**.

So if the Internet is not a private place, and something personal to you often
means it’s somewhat private, where do you share it? I’m still working towards an
answer to this one.
