In the first part of his book _Historia da igreja do Japão_ (History of the
Church of Japan), João Rodrigues noted that:

_“[The Japanese people] are so crafty in their hearts that nobody can understand
them. Whence it is said that they have three hearts: a false one in their mouths
for all the world to see, another within their breasts only for their friends,
and the third in the depths of their hearts, reserved for themselves alone and
never manifested to anybody.”_

This quote somehow today is regarded as a Japanese _saying_, and it goes
something like this:

_“[The Japanese] say you have three faces. The first face, you show to the
world. The second face, you show to your close friends, and your family. The
third face, you never show anyone. It is the truest reflection of who you are.”_

What they are talking about is how we, as humans, are always putting on a
_façade_. Do you find it weird that there are so many versions of _you_ that
exist in other people’s mind? Some may find you as that introvert who doesn’t
talk much. Others may think you’re annoying and never shut up. Some people may
think you’re cold and mean, while others may think you’re caring and loving.

The question, is: _do you care?_ The bigger question is, _why_ do you care?
