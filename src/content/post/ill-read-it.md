I’ve been reading _Manu’s_ blog for quite some time. Earlier in March, he wrote
a [blog post](https://manuelmoreale.com/i-ll-read-it) where he mentions:

> If you decide to start a blog in either English or Italian, I'll read it. I
> don't care about the topic. Start a blog, write something, send it to me, and
> I'll read it. And you'll have your first reader. If you add an RSS feed to

> post.

_You should, too_. When you do, [send it to me](mailto:hey@kimchiii.space).
_**I’ll read it**_, no matter the topic. It doesn’t matter if it’s just a line,
or two. It doesn’t matter if it’s a rant. It doesn’t matter if it’s something
personal (or not), or if it’s about an experience you had and you want to share
with the rest of the world: _I’ll read it_. If you have an
[RSS](https://aboutfeeds.com/) feed, I’ll add you to my reading list. Want me to
_proof-read_ your draft before you publish it? I’m happy to do so, as long as
its written in English.

_Document your journey. Narrate your journey. But most importantly, share your
journey. Your story is valuable. Maybe you don't see it_ (yet). _So let others._
