_This comment is taken from a submission on Hacker News about how entrepreneurs
aren’t a special breed, and it perfectly describes how I feel about
entrepreneurship. Here’s the
[original](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15659076) comment if you wish to
go read it for yourself. There are also other points people make that (I think)
are quite insightful_.

> Entrepreneurship is like one of those carnival games where you throw darts or
> something.
>
> Middle class kids can afford one throw. Most miss. A few hit the target and
> get a small prize. A very few hit the center bullseye and get a bigger prize.
> Rags to riches! The American Dream lives on.

> Rich kids can afford many throws. If they want to, they can try over and over

> keep going until they hit the center bullseye, then they give speeches or

> Poor kids aren't visiting the carnival. They’re the ones working it.

_Damn_.
