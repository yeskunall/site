**_Disclaimer_**: **Do not rely on this information when applying yourself**.
Processing times change **all the time**.

I moved to Canada to pursue engineering in 2014. At the time of writing this, it
is 30 July, 2021. So, ~2500 days. Does it take this long for everybody? No.
Could I have gotten it sooner? Yes. I was eligible in mid-2020, but I did not
apply till early 2021.

In hindsight, this was one of the easiest things to obtain, however. Was it
worth the wait, though?

## Admissibility

You can’t be a criminal, or a terrorist if you want to be considered admissible
to Canada. Seems fair enough. You could be considered inadmissible if you’ve
ever
[driven while being impaired](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/notices/impaired-driving-cannabis-penalties-affect-immigration-status.html).
It doesn’t matter if the crime happened inside or outside Canada. I think this
is fair, too. You could be considered inadmissible on grounds of your
(pre-)existing
[medical condition](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/inadmissibility/reasons/medical-inadmissibility.html).
Wait what? So I looked this up. Canada employs an excessive demand
[cost threshold](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/updates/2021-excessive-cost.html)
to determine if your medical condition holds grounds for inadmissibility. The
2021 cost threshold was CA$21,798 per year or CA$108,990 over 5 years.

Not only that, if you’re found inadmissible on medical grounds—usually during
your Immigration Medical Examination (_IME_)—then your Migration Health Branch
(_MHB_) medical officer is required to immediately make note of it in the Global
Case Management System
([_GCMS_](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/transparency/access-information-privacy/privacy-impact-assessment/global-case-management-system.html)).
Stuff no one tells you about up front. _Always read between the lines_.

## Eligibility

I was eligible for permanent residency under the Canadian Experience Class
(_CEC_). This is 1 of the 3 federal programs managed through
[Express Entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility.html).

I still cannot
[vote, or run for political office](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card/understand-pr-status.html),
but at least now I am protected under Canadian law and the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms. I can also live anywhere in Canada.

## Cost

In the years leading up to becoming a permanent resident (_PR_), the mandatory
expenses I’ve had to incur in Canada are:

- ~**$CA129,000** in tuition fee
- ~**$CA196,000** in living expenses (et al)
- ~$**CA$1,700** in PR application fee (et al)

Total: ~$**CA327,000** in 7 years.

## The wait

As I mentioned earlier, the application processing times\* change all the time.
At the time of writing this, average wait times are sitting at **180 days** for
new, and existing applications alike. Because of the pandemic, the grace periods
have also been extended to **90 days** for most situations.

\*_Processing time is the time elapsed between the day Immigration, Refugees and
Citizenship Canada (IRCC) receives your application and the day a final decision
is made on your application_.

In my case, it took only **2 days** to be invited to apply for permanent
residency. This number largely varies for each individual. From there, it took
**3 months** my application to be processed, and approved. I’ll repeat: do not
rely on this information when applying.

## Biometrics

I’ll be honest: this had me extremely uneasy. I am not against the concept of
“secure borders, open doors.” I do question how Canada (_any_ country, really)
processes, and stores my information. So I looked this up too.

> Biometrics are collected and enrolled at multiple service points, both in

> managed by private companies, contracted by IRCC to deliver biometric

**_Pause_**. _Private_ companies? My biometrics—which can be used to identify me
with increasingly good accuracy—are being processed by private companies? How
could you possibly ask me to trust private companies, especially in
**_today’s_** landscape?

_Somewhat_ reassuring, I guess? At a surface level. In reality, that statement
means nothing. On top of that, Canada
[admits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/campaigns/biometrics/protecting-appplicants-privacy.html)
they will share your information with the U.S., the United Kingdom (U.K.),
Australia and New Zealand. In short, if you’ve ever given your biometrics to one
of the G7 countries, they’re _all_ aware of your identity. If a G7 country has
_any_ ties with another country, your biometric data is most likely with
authorities of _that_ country.

## Wrapping up

As I finish typing up this post, I look back at certain points in time in my
time in Canada. I was 18 when I moved here, and I’m 25 as of today. In that
time, some interesting things of note:

- The price of a
  [Junior Chicken](https://www.mcdonalds.com/ca/en-ca/product/junior-chicken.html)
  has gone up from ~$__CA1.50__ to ~$**CA2.49**
- [UberX](https://financialpost.com/entrepreneur/fp-startups/uber-technologies-inc-toronto-launch)
  launched in 2014
- Cannabis was legalized in
  [2018](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-24.5/)
- Average monthly net salary (_after tax_) in 2014 was
  $**CA3,711.11** and
  $**CA4,009.39** in 2021

Going back to the original question: was it worth the wait? It _depends_ 😉

Ultimately, _YMMV_. But if you are thinking of immigrating to another country, I
think Canada is one of the best
[Commonwealth](https://thecommonwealth.org/about-us) countries to immigrate to.
